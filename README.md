# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project is a **Machine Learning model** that predicts house prices based on various features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and number of floors. The project demonstrates the full ML workflow: data collection, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

The goal is to provide a **predictive model** that can estimate house prices for real-world use cases, and to showcase a complete end-to-end ML workflow.
